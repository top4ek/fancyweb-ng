Your donation help us to ease the burden on their personal finances while keeping the development on the latest hardware. We also use the funds to compensate the work of part-time and full-time maintainers, and to attend trade shows, meet with hardware vendors, monitor trends in camera technology and gain access to SDK and other support materials, which are often expensive. Your contributions help us to continue development and provide technical support to the community.',
